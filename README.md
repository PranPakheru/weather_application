This a Weather Forcasting application.
In this application you can see the weather of next three days with several other features like wind speed, humidity etc.

How to use:
    1) This weather app is using free api from weatherapi.com, what you need to do is create an account there and get the api key for yourself.
    2) Create one .env file and paste the api there, call the variable in the axiosService.js file.
    3) By doing that you should be able to use my app.

Thank you soo much using the app.
